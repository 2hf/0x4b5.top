This repo holds hexo themes base on [indigo](https://github.com/yscoder/hexo-theme-indigo) and some personalized configurations for my [BLOG](http://0x4b5.top).

* `public`: static blogs folder
* `source`: enable tags by creating `tags/tag/index.md` like this

```
type: "tags"
noDate: true
comments: false

```
